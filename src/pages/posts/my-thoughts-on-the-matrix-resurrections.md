## Disclaimer

Obviously, this article will be filled with spoilers, from the new movie but also from the original trilogy. You can leave the page now, or continue reading as I break down my thoughts on this subject.

## Introduction

Firstly, it was a good movie, I liked it. It leaves the door open for more movies in the future. It was interesting, with new lore and action. I really like how the directors put small pieces here and there to criticize the current society. This movies kind of takes place in our days, where people are distracted by their phones and social media. Even if the movie is science fiction, it has deep roots within our world.

## The story

At the end of Matrix Revolutions, after Neo "killed" Agent Smith, there was a brief scene of him on a platform taken by machines. One of the machines, the Analyst, saw Neo's power and decied to use him to rebuild the Matrix. Because of that he rebuilt Neo's body and reconnected him to the Matrix, but he couldn't reactivate his special code, the reason for that was the absence of Trinity. He also resurrected her and connected her. The new version of the Matrix was based on human emotions, especially on the absence of love between Neo and Trinity. This was the best version, producing the most energy. The Analyst also added Bots, to stop people from questioning reality. Some of the most notable bots are Neo's friend at work and Trinity's family members. Their role was to stop them from wanting to exit the Matrix. The Analyst took their previous lives and made fun of them, by example Trinity's name became Tiffany and Neo's adeventure became just a game. Agent Smith returned, in a new body, without the sunglasses, as Neo's boss at their very successful company.

## Are the characters the same?

- Neo and Trinity were resurrected by the machines and their bodies were reconnected to the Matrix, so theoretically they are the same.
- The Oracle and The Architect are gone, being replaced by The Analyst, as he found a way better solution to create power from the Matrix.
- Agent Smith is an anomoly, like Neo, so as he came back to the simulation, the agent returned, but different, since he doesn't have to stop people from escaping the Matrix anymore, he just wants freedom.
- The situation gets stranger with Morpheus, as he's younger, while Neo and Trinity aged. At the beginning of the new movie, he was an agent, until Bugs offered him the red pill and he remembered his past. My theory is that Morpheus is now a program, put into the Matrix to stabilize the equation, since Neo needed him to remember his past and to escape the Matrix, again. The Analyst manipulated "the reality" as he wished to create a perfect balance and to keep Neo and Trinity separated and within the simulation.
- Niobe and Sati remained in "the real world", in IO, so they weren't affected by the changes

## What did the Analyst do differently than the Architect?

He realized Neo was the Anomaly among anomalies, even if he wasn't the One, through his own will, he became it. After the war between the machines, they needed a bigger source of energy, so they gave the power to the Analyst to construct new versions of the Matrix. Instead of using the power of human bodies, he used their emotions. He took advantage of the love between Neo and Trinity, he separated them with bots to stop them from escaping. The Analyst made Neo doubt his sanity, as he could modify the simulation. By example, when Morpheus came to Neo at his workplace, the police shot many people and Neo was almost killed by Agent Smith, it was chaos. But he used the Deja Vu cat to erase all of that, like it didn't happen. Neo lived between thoughts that confuse him, the Analyst was successful in making him doubt himself. The Matrix took Neo and Trinity adventures, something that meant to much to them, and turned it into a joke, a game. Here it is a quote from the movie: "That's what the Matrix does, it weapoizes every idea, every dream, everything that's important to us. What's better to bury truth than inside something ordinary as a video game". Any memories Neo regained, he associated them with his video game.

## Ideas

Here are some vague ideas you can get from the movie. I will let you, the reader, find examples of these things in real life:

- The system takes important ideas and uses them instead of you, making you to forget what made them important in the first place.
- The love between two people can break barriers

## Why did so many dislike it?

“Expectations are the thief of joy”

This movie was released almost 20 years after the supposed end of the trilogy, I think it's clear as daylight the original vision of the director changed through the years, and I don't think that's bad. The hardcore old fans might dislike but I think this can be a reboot, leaving the door open for future Matrix movies.
